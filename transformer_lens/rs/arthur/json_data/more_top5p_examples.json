Though corporations and individuals work to improve safeguards, it has become increasingly difficult to protect financial data and personal information from criminal activity. Fortunately, new insights into quantum physics may soon offer a solution.\n\nAs reported in The Optical Society's (OSA) new high-impact journal Optica, a team of researchers from the Netherlands has harnessed the power of quantum mechanics to create a fraud-proof method for authenticating a physical \"key\" that is virtually impossible to thwart.\n\nThis innovative security measure, known as Quantum-Secure Authentication, can confirm the identity of any person or object, including debit and credit cards, even if essential information (like the complete structure of the card) has been stolen. It uses the unique quantum properties of light to create a secure question-and-answer (Q&A) exchange that cannot be \"spoofed\" or copied.\n\nThe \"Question-and-Answer\" Security Game\n\nTraditional magnetic-stripe-only cards are relatively simple to use but also simple to copy. Recently, banks have begun issuing so-called \"smart cards\" that include a microprocessor chip to authenticate, identify and enhance security. But regardless of how complex the code or how many layers of security, the problem remains that an attacker who obtains the information stored inside the card can copy or emulate it.\n\nThe new approach outlined in this paper avoids this risk entirely by using the peculiar quantum properties of photons that allow them to be in multiple locations at the same time to convey the authentication questions and answers. Though difficult to reconcile with our everyday experiences, this strange property of light can create a fraud-proof Q&A exchange, like those used to authorize credit card transactions.\n\n\"Single photons of light have very special properties that seem to defy normal behavior,\" said Pepijn Pinkse, a researcher from the University of Twente and lead author on the paper. \"When properly harnessed, they can encode information in such a way that prevents attackers from determining what the information is.\"\n\nThe process works by transmitting a small, specific number of photons onto a specially prepared surface on a credit card and transmitting", " Immigration": " a counter to the Evangelical Immigration Table, which energetically backs Immigration", "\ufffd": " in the Senate bill, which he characterized as legalization first, border security later.\n\nKelly Kullberg organized Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration as a counter to the Evangelical Immigration Table, which energetically backs the Senate bill.

Harley Geiger, senior counsel at the civil-liberties group the Center for Democracy and Technology, described the move as \u201cforcing bad policy through must-pass legislation.\u201d Kevin Bankston, director of New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute, called it \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\nRep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), one of four lawmakers who sent a letter to his colleagues urging them to oppose adding cyber legislation to the omnibus, called the legislation \u201cunconstitutional surveillance\u201d and \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d Sen.

But while the proposals sharpen the discussion about reform, they don't end it.\n\n\"With their proposals today, the administration has moved this critical debate from broad discussion to specific action,\" said Timothy Ryan of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.\n\nThe administration's plan leans heavily on the Fed, expanding its role as the regulator of the nation's largest banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to include other giant financial firms, such as the insurance companies American International Group and MetLife. The agency, which has greater independence from the political process than other regulators, would have broad authority to impose special requirements on those companies, such as mandating that they set aside a larger percentage of their assets against possible losses than smaller firms. Such a requirement could limit large companies' appetite for risk, but also their profit and growth.\n\nThe plan calls for a council of regulators to consult with the Fed, including the Treasury secretary and the heads of the other financial regulatory agencies: The Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the agencies that regulate banks. A primary task of the council would be to recommend which large, globally interconnected firms are too big to fail and should be subject to more rigorous oversight. But the council will not have the authority to oppose decisions made by the central bank.\n\nAgencies other than the Fed pressed for the creation of such a council, but its limited role is likely to disappoint them. Prominent Democrats and Republicans in Congress also have signaled that they are reluctant to increase the Fed's powers without imposing stronger limitations.\n\nA second element likely to provoke fierce debate is the establishment of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency.\n\nThe agency would have broad authority to overhaul a tangled mess of federal regulations, such as the various laws that compel lenders to give mortgage borrowers a massive stack of paperwork at closing that includes several calculations of the true cost of the loan itself.\n\n\"Consumers should have clear disclosure regarding the consequences of their financial decisions,\" the plan states.\n\nThe agency also would have the authority to change the way that loans are sold.
