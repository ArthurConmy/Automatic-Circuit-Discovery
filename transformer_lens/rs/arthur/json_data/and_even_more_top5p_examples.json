I would like to welcome the witnesses, Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry and General Stanley A. McChrystal, and thank them for appearing before this Committee.\n\nI have serious concerns, however, about the president\u2019s decision to add some 30,000 troops and an as yet undisclosed number of civilian personnel to escalate our Afghan operation. This \u0093surge\u0094 will bring US troop levels to approximately those of the Soviets when they occupied Afghanistan with disastrous result back in the 1980s. I fear the US military occupation of Afghanistan may end up similarly unsuccessful.\n\nIn late 1986 Soviet armed forces commander, Marshal Sergei Akhromeev, told then-Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, \"Military actions in Afghanistan will soon be seven years old. There is no single piece of land in this country which has not been occupied by a Soviet soldier. Nonetheless, the majority of the territory remains in the hands of rebels.\u0094 Soon Gorbachev began the Soviet withdrawal from its Afghan misadventure. Thousands were dead on both sides, yet the occupation failed to produce a stable national Afghan government.\n\nEight years into our own war in Afghanistan the Soviet commander\u2019s words ring eerily familiar. Part of the problem stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation. It is our presence as occupiers that feeds the insurgency. As would be the case if we were invaded and occupied, diverse groups have put aside their disagreements to unify against foreign occupation. Adding more US troops will only assist those who recruit fighters to attack our soldiers and who use the US occupation to convince villages to side with the Taliban.\n\nThe Revolution: A Mani...

(Reuters)\n\nOn Monday morning, President Trump met with business leaders to present a plan for keeping jobs in the United States. He offered a carrot \u2014 a dramatic cut in taxes and regulations \u2014 as well as a stick \u2014 a substantial tax on companies that decide to send their factories offshore.\n\nWhether companies follow suit will depend on how they weigh the benefits Trump is offering with the potential higher costs of keeping production in the United States. But in Trump\u2019s statements, he claimed that the move would have no cost at all \u2014 a statement that rankled some economists.\n\n\u201cThere will be advantages to companies that do indeed make their products here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I've always said, by the time you put them in these massive ships or airplanes and fly them and \u2014 I think it's gonna be cheaper.\u201d\n\nEconomists disagreed. Although some said the policy could benefit some American workers by creating jobs and in turn expanding the U.S. economy, most said it would also impose a greater cost on companies, who would in turn pass those costs on to consumers. Either consumers would buy goods made in the United States, which would be more expensive because of the higher cost of American wages, or they would buy foreign goods that would be pricier because they had been subject to an additional tax.\n\n\u201cCompanies of course have these international supply chains because it makes it cheaper for them to produce their products. So almost inevitably, if you don\u2019t let them do that, their products will become more expensive for consumers,\u201d said Stan Veuger, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cFor sure it\u2019s going to increase prices.\u201d\n\nJust how much prices would increase if more goods are made in the United States is unclear, but it could be substantial.
