# Automatic Circuit Discovery 

## Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery
cd Automatic-Circuit-Discovery
pip install -e .
```

You may need to install DeepMind's `tracr` MANUALLY as the auto install is currently broken

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6
```

in order to install graphics dependencies on linux.

## Tests (not currently mantained!)

From the root directory, run 

```bash
pytest tests/acdc -vv
```

# [DEPRECATED] <a href="https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery/commit/f18007e53b8f96cc49c53f372bae7fa798fc7322)">Old Implementation</a>

This repository contains the code for direct path patching experiments as described <a href="https://arthurconmy.github.io/automatic_circuit_discovery/">on my blog</a>.

An example of a circuit that can be automatically found.

This is different from the <a href="https://github.com/redwoodresearch/Easy-Transformer">code from the IOI paper</a> and from the <a href="https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer">base EasyTransformer</a> (which should be referred to for learning).

See the notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArthurConmy/Easy-Transformer/blob/main/AutomaticCircuitDiscovery.ipynb to demo this code, and produce a plot like the one above.

## Example uses
 
This work was used at a mechanistic interpretability hackathon: https://itch.io/jam/mechint/rate/1889871 . You can play with the notebook <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qXZ_7thqs8lks7n1SayijQswP5AKmrP8?usp=sharing">here</a>.
