This repository contains the code for direct path patching experiments as described <a href="https://arthurconmy.github.io/automatic_circuit_discovery/">on my blog</a>.

An example of a circuit that can be automatically found.

This is different from the <a href="https://github.com/redwoodresearch/Easy-Transformer">code from the IOI paper</a> and from the <a href="https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer">base EasyTransformer</a> (which should be referred to for learning).

See the notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArthurConmy/Easy-Transformer/blob/main/AutomaticCircuitDiscovery.ipynb to demo this code, and produce a plot like the one above.

# Example uses
 
This work was used at a mechanistic interpretability hackathon: https://itch.io/jam/mechint/rate/1889871 . You can play with the notebook <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qXZ_7thqs8lks7n1SayijQswP5AKmrP8?usp=sharing">here</a>.
