    PLACEHOLDER generally like 2. but where there are generally multiple parents. Here in ACDC we just include these edges by default when we find them. Explained below?
    
    Q: Why do we do this?

    There are two answers to this question: A1 is an interactive notebook, see <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery/blob/main/notebooks/colabs/ACDC_Editing_Edges_Demo.ipynb">this Colab notebook</a>, which is in this repo at notebooks/implementation_demo.py. A2 is an answer that is written here below, but probably not as clear as A1 (though shorter).

    A2: We need something inside TransformerLens to represent the edges of a computational graph.
    The object we choose is pairs (hook_name, index). For example the output of Layer 11 Heads is a hook (blocks.11.attn.hook_result) and to sepcify the 3rd head we add the index [:, :, 3]. Then we can build a computational graph on these! 

    However, when we do ACDC there turn out to be two conflicting things "removing edges" wants to do: 
    i) for things in the residual stream, we want to remove the sum of the effects from previous hooks 
    ii) for things that are not linear we want to *recompute* e.g the result inside the hook 
    blocks.11.attn.hook_result from a corrupted Q and normal K and V

    The easiest way I thought of of reconciling these different cases, while also having a connected computational graph, is to have three types of edges: addition for the residual case, direct computation for easy cases where we can just replace hook_q with a cached value when we e.g cut it off from hook_q_input, and placeholder to make the graph connected (when hook_result is connected to hook_q and hook_k and hook_v)"""
