    " <h2>Title: How does factual information flow through language models?</h2>\n",
    " <p>Geva et. al (2023) refine the hypothesis in the ROME paper that factual information flows through models via early(-mid) layer MLPs and late-layer attention heads. Specifically, they find that “subject-enrichment” occurs at the final subject position by MLPs, and late-layer attention heads extract attributes (an operation more complex than mere copying).</p>\n",
    " <p>Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14767.pdf</p>\n",
    " <p>However, Geva et. al’s analysis is limited. In Section 5 (in the “Attention Knockout” paragraph), they intervene on attention layers by overwriting attention scores. This neglects i) the effect of individual attention heads and ii) the effect of individual earlier attention heads or layers (rather than simply ALL earlier attention heads/layers). Similarly, Section 7.3 performs a patching experiment that involves setting all future layers’ attention inputs to a particular value. Again isolating individual layer-to-layer (or head-to-head) effects could localize behavior more.</p>\n",
    " <p> In this notebook we firstly refine the later layer model components that matter and then find the early layer components that matter."
