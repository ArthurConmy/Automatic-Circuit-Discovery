    A wrapper around a dictionary of cached activations from a model run, with a variety of helper functions.

    WARNING: The biggest footgun and source of bugs in this code will be keeping track of indexes, dimensions, and the numbers of each. There are several kinds of activations:

    Internal attn head vectors: q, k, v, z. Shape [batch, pos, head_index, d_head]
    Internal attn pattern style results: attn (post softmax), attn_scores (pre-softmax). Shape [batch, head_index, query_pos, key_pos]
    Attn head results: result. Shape [batch, pos, head_index, d_model]
    Internal MLP vectors: pre, post, mid (only used for solu_ln - the part between activation + layernorm). Shape [batch, pos, d_mlp]
    Residual stream vectors: resid_pre, resid_mid, resid_post, attn_out, mlp_out, embed, pos_embed, normalized (output of each LN or LNPre). Shape [batch, pos, d_model]
    LayerNorm Scale: scale. Shape [batch, pos, 1]

    Sometimes the batch dimension will be missing because we applied remove_batch_dim (used when batch_size=1), and we need functions to be robust to that. I THINK I've got everything working, but could easily be wrong!
